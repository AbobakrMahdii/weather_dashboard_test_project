# Hook Organization Patterns

## Overview

This document outlines strategies for organizing complex React hooks to improve maintainability, readability, and testability. We've applied these patterns to our authentication system in the `useAuth` hook.

## Challenges with Large Hooks

As hooks grow in complexity, they can become difficult to maintain:

- Long functions with many responsibilities
- Difficult to understand the hook's overall purpose
- Hard to test individual pieces of functionality
- Code duplication between similar hooks

## Solution: Modular Hook Structure

Instead of keeping all logic inside a single function, we separate a complex hook into distinct parts:

```
src/features/auth/hooks/useAuth.ts
├── Helper Types
├── Helper Functions
│   ├── useAuthInit() - Authentication initialization
│   ├── handleLogin() - Login logic
│   └── handleLogout() - Logout logic
└── useAuth() - Main hook that composes functionality
```

## Implementation Techniques

### 1. Helper Hook Functions

Small hooks that handle a specific part of the state or behavior:

```typescript
function useAuthInit(dispatch: ReturnType<typeof useDispatch>) {
  // State initialization and auth bootstrapping
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  // ...more state...

  useEffect(() => {
    // Initialize auth state
    // ...
  }, [dispatch]);

  return { 
    isLoading,
    setIsLoading,
    // ...other state and setters... 
  };
}
```

### 2. Pure Handler Functions

Functions that encapsulate operation logic without React dependencies:

```typescript
function handleLogin(
  credentials: LoginCredentials,
  stateHandlers: AuthStateHandlers
) {
  return async () => {
    // Login logic using the provided state handlers
    // ...
  };
}
```

### 3. Function Composition with useCallback

The main hook composes these parts together with memoization:

```typescript
export function useAuth() {
  // Get shared state from helper hook
  const {
    isLoading,
    // ...other state and setters...
  } = useAuthInit(dispatch);

  // Create state handler object for pure functions
  const stateHandlers = {
    setIsLoading,
    // ...other handlers...
  };

  // Create memoized operation functions
  const login = useCallback(
    (credentials) => handleLogin(credentials, stateHandlers)(),
    [stateHandlers]
  );

  return {
    isLoading,
    login,
    // ...other values and operations...
  };
}
```

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. Improved Readability

- Each function has a clear, single responsibility
- The main hook is concise and focused on composition
- Supporting logic is organized into separate functions

### 2. Better Testability

- Pure handler functions can be tested in isolation
- Helper hooks can be tested independently
- Easier to mock dependencies for testing

### 3. Enhanced Maintainability

- Changes to one part don't affect others
- New operations can be added as new handler functions
- Common patterns are easier to recognize

### 4. Optimized Performance

- Functions are properly memoized with useCallback
- Dependencies are clearly defined
- State updates are more predictable

## When to Apply This Pattern

Consider using this modular hook organization when:

1. Hooks grow beyond ~50 lines of code
2. A hook handles multiple related operations
3. There's shared state logic between operations
4. You want to improve testability

By applying these patterns, we've made our authentication system more maintainable while preserving a clean API for components consuming the hook.
